Data
-big data - exponential growth and availability of data
--volume - factors that increase data size
--velocity - speed data streams, timely manner
--variety - structured, unstructured, lots of different types
-main memory, single disk, or among computers,

Data Structures
-any data representation AND its associated operations.
-select based on basic operations needed and resource constraints (data storage space)

Abstract Data Types
-type is a collection of values (boolean has true/false)
-data type is a type together with a collection of operations to manipulate the type
-abstract data type is the declaration of a data type as a software component
--does not specify how the data type is implemented
--data structure is the implementation for ADT

Algorithms
-a computational problem is a function or a mapping of inputs to outputs
-algorithm is an expact specification of how to solve a computational problem
--complexity: space & running time
-program is the instantiation of an algoirthm in a programming language
