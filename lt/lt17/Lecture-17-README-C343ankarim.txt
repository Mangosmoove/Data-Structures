No matter what, there are n elements that can be compared to each other
so that would determine the lower bound of an algorithm
If we only count a subset of all the operations, we're still counting big-omega
the lower bound can't be lower than what we find.

COUNTING SORT
-not going to compare because it would take nlogn operations
-takes linear time to max key value and number of elements
-takes up a lot of space

-Bubble sort
--time complexity: n^2
--space complexity: 1
-Counting sort
--time complexity: n
--space complexity: n + maxKeyValue
